At Cboard, our mission has always been to make communication more accessible, personal, and meaningful for everyone. That's why we are thrilled to announce a new collaboration with ElevenLabs — a leader in AI-powered voice technology.

This partnership makes it possible for Cboard users to **create a personalized synthetic voice from old recordings**, bringing a new level of individuality and connection to AAC communication.

## Why this matters

For many AAC users, especially people living with conditions such as ALS, the ability to preserve their own voice can be life-changing. Voice is not just a tool — it's part of who we are. Being able to continue using a familiar, personal voice helps maintain identity, dignity, and emotional connection with loved ones.

With ElevenLabs' technology, even a short recording can be transformed into a **fully functional digital voice** that can be used directly within Cboard. This means that users no longer have to rely on generic synthesized voices — instead, they can communicate with a voice that truly feels like their own.
