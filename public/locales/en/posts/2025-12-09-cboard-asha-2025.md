This year, the Cboard team had the opportunity to attend **ASHA 2025 in Washington D.C**. It was our first time at the conference, and an incredible experience.

Throughout the conference, we attended sessions that broadened our understanding of how technology can responsibly support communication. One standout theme was the ethical use of AI in speech therapy, and assistive technology. These conversations centered around transparency, user involvement, and safety. These are all essential considerations as we continue developing ethical assistive technologies at Cboard.

## Connecting with the Community

We also spent hours speaking with speech-language pathologists, educators, and researchers about the real-world barriers people face when trying to access accessible assistive tech. These conversations reaffirmed what drives our work: the need for tools that are not only high quality, but also equitable, customizable, and grounded in the lived experiences of the people who use them.
