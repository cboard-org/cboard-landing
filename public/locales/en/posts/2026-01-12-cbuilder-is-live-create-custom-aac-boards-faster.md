Creating AAC boards is deeply skilled work, but it often comes with a frustrating reality: the more personalized the board needs to be, the more time it takes to build. For speech therapists, special educators, and education centers, that time pressure stacks up fast—especially when you're supporting multiple learners, multiple routines, and multiple classrooms.

**Cbuilder is designed to remove that bottleneck.** It uses AI to help you generate a strong first draft of a customized AAC board in minutes, so you can spend your energy where it matters most: tailoring communication to the person, modeling language, and iterating based on what works in real life.

If you're curious, explore it at **[www.cbuilder.io](http://www.cbuilder.io)**.

## How Cbuilder Works

Cbuilder works best when you start with intent instead of a blank grid. You can prompt it with a context like a classroom routine, snack time, a morning schedule, self-advocacy, a storybook theme, or a specific learning activity. The AI helps organize vocabulary and structure quickly, giving you a ready-to-edit board that you can refine with your professional judgment. The goal isn't to "replace" expertise—it's to eliminate repetitive setup so personalization becomes easier and faster.

## Seamless Export to Cboard and Beyond

One of the biggest advantages is what happens next: **boards can be seamlessly exported to Cboard**, which means you can go from creation to real-world use without friction. And this is just the beginning—**export to many more AAC tools will be available soon**, giving teams and centers the flexibility to fit different devices, preferences, and workflows.

## Empowering Education Centers

For education centers, this is especially powerful. When board creation speeds up, AAC implementation becomes more scalable across staff and classrooms. You can respond faster when needs change, build boards for more daily contexts (not just the "main" one), and reduce the dependency on a single AAC expert to carry everything. That shift—less time building, more time communicating—can dramatically improve consistency and participation.
