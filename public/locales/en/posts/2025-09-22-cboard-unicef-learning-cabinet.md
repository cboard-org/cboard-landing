## Cboard has been selected for the [Learning Cabinet](https://www.learningcabinet.org/tool/cboard-aac/)!

The Learning Cabinet is a global platform where policymakers, donors, and education leaders discover and evaluate trusted EdTech solutions. To be included, each solution must pass a **rigorous expert assessment** based on the *EdTech for Good Framework.* The Learning Cabinet was developed by UNICEF, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and ARM (UK technology company).
