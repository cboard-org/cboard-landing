### <a name='Whatisthedifferencebetweenaregisteredandanon-registereduser'></a>What is the difference between a registered and a non-registered user?

A registered user is able to personalize their boards, and the changes made will be saved to their account so that when they log back in, they can use their customized boards. A non-registered user won't be able to save changes safely. We recommend registering just in case, so your changes are guaranteed to be saved.

## <a name='Features'></a>Features

### <a name='WhatdevicesandOSaresupported'></a>What devices and OS are supported?

Cboard is available online using a wide variety of devices, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones using Mac, Windows and Android operating systems. It is best viewed in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari and an Android app is available from Google Play.

![Browser support](/images/help/browsers.png "Browser support")

Because Cboard is a web based app it will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

Don’t forget you can also use browser magnification or zoom to a certain degree depending on the computer, tablet or phone screen size.

Please ask Cboard about using high contrast mode for those with visual impairment as browser based options are not helpful when using this type of web app.

### <a name='WhichlanguagesaresupportedbyCboard'></a>Which languages are supported by Cboard?

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

<div><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHq9b3dJ0zM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

### <a name='CanCboardreadmymessageoutaloud'></a>Can Cboard read my message out aloud?

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box. You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud. If a personalised recording of a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice. This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child's voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable. Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone.

### <a name='HowdoesLiveModeWork'></a>How does Live Mode work?

Live Mode is an advanced feature designed for users who can type, providing a more direct way to communicate through Cboard. When enabled, Live Mode transforms the communication experience by allowing direct text input.

**What is Live Mode?** Live Mode allows users to type text directly into the output bar instead of selecting symbols from boards. This feature is particularly useful for literate users who want faster communication or need to express complex thoughts that might not be easily represented through symbols alone.

**How to Enable Live Mode:**

1. Unlock the Cboard interface by clicking the lock icon three times
2. Go to Settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to "Navigation and Buttons" under the System section
4. Toggle on "Use the Live Mode"
5. Save your settings

**How Live Mode Works:**

- **Direct Text Input**: Simply click in the output bar and type your message using your keyboard
- **Instant Playback**: After typing, click the play button or press Enter to hear your text spoken aloud using the selected voice
- **Symbol Integration**: You can still use symbols alongside typed text - they work together seamlessly
- **Quick Communication**: Perfect for urgent messages, proper nouns, or specific terms not available in symbol sets

**When to Use Live Mode:**

- **Literate Users**: Ideal for users who can read and write but benefit from AAC support
- **Complex Messages**: When you need to express detailed or nuanced thoughts
- **Proper Nouns**: For names, places, or specific terms not in symbol libraries
- **Temporary Communication Needs**: When symbols might be slower than typing
- **Educational Settings**: Helpful for students learning to transition between symbols and text

**Tips for Using Live Mode:**

- Live Mode works best with users who have basic typing skills
- You can switch between Live Mode and symbol selection as needed
- The feature respects all your voice and speech settings
- Text entered in Live Mode can be shared using the phrase sharing feature

Live Mode represents Cboard's commitment to supporting users across different literacy levels and communication preferences, ensuring that everyone can communicate effectively regardless of their preferred method.

### <a name='Speechcapabilities'></a>Speech capabilities

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into SETTINGS, and under the LANGUAGE category is the SPEECH category. When you select SPEECH, you will be able to configure several voice options:

**Voice Selection** - Choose from available voices on your device. The interface will display the currently selected voice (e.g., "Microsoft David - English (United States)").

**Pitch Control** - Use the pitch slider to make the voice use a higher or lower pitch. This can help personalize the voice to better match the user's preferences.

**Rate Control** - Use the rate slider to make the voice speak faster or slower. This is particularly helpful for users who need more time to process speech or prefer quicker communication.

These settings allow you to customize the text-to-speech output to match individual user needs and preferences. Changes take effect immediately when you adjust the sliders.

![Speech capabilities](/images/help/speech.png "Speech capabilities")

### <a name='Exportandimport'></a>Export and import

Both export and import options are available within SETTINGS in the SYSTEM category, below Language and Speech. These features allow you to backup your boards and share them with others.

![Export capabilities](/images/help/export.png "Export capabilities")

### <a name='Displaycapabilities'></a>Display capabilities

Display settings can be edited in SETTINGS, within the SYSTEM category. The Display option is right below Export and Import. Once you select DISPLAY, you can configure several visual aspects of Cboard:

All changes take effect immediately, and you should click "Save" to preserve your preferences.

![Display capabilities](/images/help/display.png "Display capabilities")

### <a name='CanIchangeanynavigationsettings'></a>Can I change any navigation settings?

Use the NAVIGATION AND BUTTONS section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the SYSTEM Category in SETTINGS allows you to configure several helpful options:

**Enable context aware back button** - Shows big back buttons. You can select the desired style in navigation buttons style section.

**Enable big scroll buttons** - Shows big scroll buttons for easier navigation, especially useful for eye-tracker device users as the buttons allow scrolling without needing to slide the screen.

**Navigation buttons style** - Select the style of the context-aware back and big scroll buttons. "On the sides" is recommended for eye trackers.

**Show the share phrase button** - Show a share button (next to backspace button) that allows sharing the selected symbols.

**Remove symbols from the output bar** - Shows an "x" button on each symbol to remove it. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence, but be aware of user needs as it can also confuse some individuals.

**Enable quick settings unlock** - Unlocks the settings with a single click instead of requiring three clicks.

**Enable folder vocalization** - Reads folder names out loud when clicked.

**Enable Quiet Builder mode** - Disables vocalization of tiles when they are clicked as you build a sentence. Click output bar to hear the constructed sentence.

**Use the Live Mode** - Live mode allows you to write text directly into the output bar and quickly play the sound. It is intended for users that can write.

## <a name='BoardEditing'></a>Board Editing

### <a name='HowdoIcreateanemptyboard'></a>How do I create an empty board?

In Cboard an empty board is equivalent to a folder.

If you want to create a new or empty board you have to create a new folder, and that will create a new board in the Cboard storage area (which you can see when you go to BOARDS on the middle bar in edit mode).

The new empty board will be immediately available for editing and can be set as the root board (using the build button), which means that it will be the first board you see the next time you open Cboard.

To create a new folder, begin by unlocking the screen selecting the lock button on the right hand side. Once you unlock the screen, select the plus (+) symbol on the right hand side, in order to ADD TILE. You will then be given the option to add a Tile / BUTTON which is the first and automatic option or select the FOLDER This action makes a NEW BOARD to which you can add more tiles and folders.

Once you have named the folder you can upload an image in a similar manner to making a tile with a color setting and label. This new folder will automatically link to a board above it (if included a row of tiles). It will appear in your list of boards as an empty board until it is populated with symbols and labels.

### <a name='BigScrollButtons'></a>Screen scroll through big buttons

It is also possible to scroll up and down a board using a couple of big buttons that can be added from the settings section. This is especially useful for eye-tracker device users, as the buttons allow to scroll the board without needing to slide the screen. To enable this feature, go to the settings section and look for the "enable big scroll buttons " switch. Toggle the switch and save the settings. See figure below:

Then, you should see a couple of big buttons at the top and the bottom of a board if it is large enough, as displayed in the below image:

### <a name='CanIusescanningtechniquestoaccesssymbols'></a>Can I use scanning techniques to access symbols?

Scanning is where the items in the selection set are presented sequentially over time and the user makes a selection indirectly, usually by switch access. SCANNING on Cboard works within SETTINGS and the SYSTEM category. There are several scanning options available:

**Enable Scanning** - Toggle to start scanning boards immediately when enabled.

**Time Delay** - Configure the time between two consecutive scanning highlights. The default is 2 seconds, but you can adjust this based on user needs.

**Scan Method** - Choose between different scanning methods:

- Automatic - The scanner automatically moves through elements
- Manual - User controls when the scanner moves to the next element

**Usage Instructions:**

- Scanner will iterate over elements, press any key to select them
- Press Escape 4 times to deactivate Scanner
- The scanning system highlights elements in sequence, allowing users with limited mobility to make selections using a single switch or key press

Please be aware that when using a tablet or smartphone, it may also have its own built-in scanning option that can be used alongside or instead of Cboard's scanning features.
