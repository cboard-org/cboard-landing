# New Collaboration: User Testing with the Esteban Bullrich Foundation!

#### April 23, 2025 by [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbedouret/)

We are proud to announce that Cboard has signed a collaboration agreement with the Esteban Bullrich Foundation to conduct user testing of **FluidMind** during May and June 2025.

This partnership represents a key step in bringing FluidMind — our AI-driven communication solution — closer to the people who need it most. Thanks to the collaboration with the Esteban Bullrich Foundation, individuals living with speech and motor impairments will have the opportunity to test the alpha version of FluidMind, helping us refine and enhance the tool based on real-world feedback.

We are grateful to the Esteban Bullrich Foundation for joining us in this journey, and we look forward to learning from the participants' experiences as we continue building a more accessible and empowering future.

Stay tuned for more updates as we move forward together!
