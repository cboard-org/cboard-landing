TWe are thrilled to announce that Cboard has signed an agreement with the Team Gleason Foundation to launch user testing of the alpha version of **FluidMind**, our next-generation AI-powered communication tool.

This collaboration marks a major milestone in our mission to enhance real-time communication for individuals with speech and motor impairments. Through this partnership, patients supported by Team Gleason will be among the first to experience and help shape the future of FluidMind, providing invaluable feedback that will drive the development of a more intuitive, powerful AAC solution.

We are deeply honored to work alongside Team Gleason — _a leading voice in the ALS and disability communities_ — and excited about the positive impact this initiative will create.

Stay tuned as we continue to build a more connected and inclusive world, one conversation at a time.
