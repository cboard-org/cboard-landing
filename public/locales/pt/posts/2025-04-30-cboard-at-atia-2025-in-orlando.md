The Cboard team had the pleasure of attending ATIA 2025 this year in Orlando, Florida — one of the largest and most influential events for assistive technology professionals, developers, and users. It was an incredible opportunity to connect with fellow AAC developers, educators, and individuals who use AAC every day.

ATIA 2025 provided an incredible platform for us to showcase our latest advancements in assistive technology. We had the opportunity to engage with industry leaders, educators, and end-users, gaining valuable feedback and insights to further enhance our solutions.
We were proud to present our session **"Cboard AAC Artificial Intelligence Innovation: CBuilder and Fluid Mind Products."** In this talk, we shared our latest work exploring the role of AI in enhancing AAC tools, with a focus on our two new apps, CBuilder and Fluid Mind, which are currently in testing. The response was overwhelmingly positive — it was thrilling to be surrounded by people who were not only interested in our work but genuinely eager to share it with those who could benefit from it.

## Key Highlights from ATIA 2025

We were especially excited to have our co-founder travel all the way from Argentina to join us at the conference. It was a meaningful moment for our team, and a wonderful chance to finally meet in person with many collaborators and community members we had previously only connected with virtually.

In addition to our presentation, we had a booth in the exhibit hall where we showcased everything we’ve been working on. It was a fantastic space to share live demos, engage in conversations, and get feedback directly from AAC users, families, and practitioners. Walking around the exhibit hall, we were inspired by the variety of innovation on display — especially the increasing integration of AI in AAC technology.
ATIA 2025 left us feeling inspired, energized, and more committed than ever to advancing accessible communication through inclusive, community-driven innovation.
